    "CONCLUSION: Accuracy for the opti,ized model is 79.07% and loss was 40.02%  With this model we are/were able to predict approximately 79% of the campaigns or organizations that would be successful. We achieved a target predictive accuracy higher than 75% by dropping the \"STATUS\" and \"SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\" Columns.  However, we retained the \"NAME\" column in case name sake or reputation were part of the success of the campaign.  Several changes were made to the model: 1) Changed the layer1Nodes to 100  2) Added a third set of nodes with a value of 30.  Thus, we had three hidden nodes with node values for 100, 30 and 10, respectively; 3) The activation for the second hidden layer was change from 'relu\" to 'sigmoid'."
