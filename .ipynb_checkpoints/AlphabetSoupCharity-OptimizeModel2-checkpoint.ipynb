As written earlier, the other/first optimization met the homework requirements of generating a model wtih accuracy greater than 75%.  This model is just for fun and to \"learn\"/\"see\" the impact of making changed to the just some of the model settings.  \n",

I wish I had more time to \"play\" with this homework.  I would determine other columns to drop or add back, add additional hidden layers and used differing activations.  I wish this was a year long boot camp so we had the time to start getting into the math, etc. behind all of this. \n",
